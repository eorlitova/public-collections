Name: Belgium - Flanders GSAA
Description: |
  Flemish Geo-spatial Aid Application (GSAA) data is managed by [the Belgium Department of Agriculture and Fisheries](https://lv.vlaanderen.be/nl).
  It contains the parcels that are in agricultural use on the deadline for submission of the single application that year. 
  The register also includes pounds, wood edges and agricultural production facilities (stables and similar buildings). 
  The inventory of these parcels takes place annually in the context of the payment of the (co-financed) European agricultural 
  subsidies and the Flemish manure legislation. It can be used for consultation or study of the land use of agricultural parcels for the year in question. 
  This dataset does not contain all data from original GSAA dataset. 
  Only the main crop and the production method are included as attribute information. 
  Flanders GSAA data collection is made available on geoDB on subscription basis.
