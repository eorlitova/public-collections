## Short description

Planes parked on the runway during lockdown in Frankfurt Airport, May 12, 2020  
Travel restrictions measures taken across Europe to prevent the spread of the Covid 19 virus have significantly reduced the number of air passengers. This significant decrease of the demand for air travel led to many unused airplanes, and an increasing need for airplanes long-term storage. In Frankfurt airport, the number of passengers carried fell by 3.5 million in comparison with March 2019. Some planes were parked on the runways for lack of space, and in order to facilitate maintenance operations: to maximize the space, planes have been towed and parked closely together, where technicians can work and get them back into service quickly once demand for air travel picks up.
