Name: Sweden LPIS
Description: |
  Sweden's Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data collection (also agricultural blocks/ 'jordbruksblock') is managed by the [Swedish Board of Agriculture](https://jordbruksverket.se/e-tjanster-databaser-och-appar/e-tjanster-och-databaser-stod/kartor-och-gis), 
  and also made available on the [INSPIRE Geoportal](https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/results.html?country=se&view=details&theme=none). 
  The Swedish agricultural blocks are vector data containing information on maximum eligible agricultural land according to EU definitions. 
  The agricultural blocks are used by the Swedish Board of Agriculture to administer support to farmers,
  therefore the collection does not include all agricultural land in Sweden, but only the parts that a farmer has sought support for at some time.
  The agricultural blocks were first(1997) obtained from the Land Survey's land cover and since then the orthophotos produced by [Lantm√§teriet](https://www.lantmateriet.se/sv/Om-Lantmateriet/Om-oss/Vart-samordningsansvar/),
  as well as field visits have been used to update the boundaries.
  Sweden LPIS data collection is made available on geoDB on subscription basis.
