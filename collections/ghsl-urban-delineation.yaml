Name: GHSL Urban Delineation
BYOAID: ghls-urban-delineation
Description: |
  Urban delineation algorithm classify and delineate urban clusters by typologies. Method was developed by Joint Research Centre (JRC) and described in Atlas of Human Planet 2019 
  The algorithm uses the global-coverage built-up (GHS-BUILT-S_GLOBE_R2022A) and population (GHS-POP_GLOBE_R2022A) raster datasets as the input data (JRC’s GHSL).
  The algorithm classifies and delineates urban clusters at two hierarchical levels.
  At the first hierarchical level, the algorithm identifies the High Density Clusters (Urban Centre) and Moderate Density Clusters.
  At the second hierarchical level, the algorithm identifies the High Density Clusters (Urban Centre), Dense Urban Clusters, Semi-Dense Urban Clusters and Peri-Urban Clusters.

  To run the urban delineation, navigate to [EDC Browser](https://browser.eurodatacube.com/?zoom=6&lat=47.44295&lng=10.71167&fromTime=1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&toTime=2020-01-01T17%3A32%3A46.781Z&algorithm=ghls-urban-delineation), 
  select the required input parameters (Area of interest and Reference year) and follow the check-out wizard to complete your order. Produced data will be uploaded directly into your folder /result-data in JupyterLab environment on EDC.
