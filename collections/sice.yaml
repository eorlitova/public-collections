Name: Operational Sentinel-3 snow and ice products (SICE)
BYOAID: sice
Description: |
  Operational Sentinel-3 snow and ice products (SICE) is a modification of the original algorithm developed by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) which is available [here](https://github.com/GEUS-SICE/SICE). The algorithms were originally developed after the work from Kokhanovsky et al. (2018, 2019, 2020). 

  The EDC SICE algorithm produces the same results but it's integrated with the Sentinel Hub infrastructure which allows the user to obtain the results much faster and at higher resolutions. The algorithm uses the already geopositioned and orthorectified S3 - Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data provided by Sentinel Hub API in order to calculate different snow optical properties such as snow spectral and broadband albedo and also snow microstructure (snow specific surface area and effective optical grain size). Theoretical basis of the algorithm can be obtained [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345375161_Pre-operational_Sentinel-3_Snow_and_Ice_SICE_Products_Algorithm_Theoretical_Basis_Document) and [here](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202009.0529/v1). 

  Since the algorithm relies heavily on the sun zenith angle (SZA), the best results for the northern polar regions can be obtained for the periods between May and September (depending on the location Latitude).  

  To generate the SICE data, navigate to [EDC Browser](https://browser.eurodatacube.com/?zoom=4&lat=74.70645&lng=-45.84855&fromTime=1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&toTime=2021-10-22T14%3A36%3A31.329Z&algorithm=sice), 
  select the required input parameters and follow the check-out wizard to complete your order. Produced data will be uploaded directly into your JupyterLab environment on EDC.

Pricing: |
  Prices are defined based on the selected AOI and resolution which can be selected arbitrarily between 300 m and 2000 m. There is not a direct €/km2 formula available as the AOI is first mapped onto 1 degree tiles and the price is calculated based on the number of tiles to be processed. Simplified a bit the "average" price for processing 1 tile (~10.000 km2) per single day would be € 0.02375 for a resolution below 400 m, € 0.0075 for a resolution between 400 m and 1.000 m, and € 0.0025 for a resolution above 1.000 m. Regardless of the size and resolution, the minimal cost for initiating request is 10 EDC credits.
