Name: Cloud to Street - Microsoft Flood Dataset - Sentinel-1
Description: |
  The Cloud to Street - Microsoft Flood Dataset (C2S-MS Floods) is a dataset of near-coincident Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data paired with water labels from 18 global flood events. These labels are derived products of MODIS sensor on board NASA's Aqua and Terra satellites produced as a part of the study, "Satellite imaging reveals increased proportion of population exposed to floods," Nature (2021), doi: 10.1038/s41586-021-03695-w. 
  In this collection, we keep the water label which represents the maximum observed flood extent during the time period of the event. For a detailed description of the methods used to generate these labels, please refer to the original paper.
