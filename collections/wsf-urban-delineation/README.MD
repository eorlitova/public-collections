# Urban Delineation

## Short description 

Urban delineation algorithm classify and delineate urban clusters by typologies. Method was developed by Joint Research Centre (JRC) and described in Atlas of Human Planet 2019. 
Urban Delineation algorithm has been adapted to utilize the WSF2019population dataset at a resolution of 10 meters. 

## WSF Data products

The WSF2019population dataset is provided by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and describes the spatial distribution of the human population. This dataset is currently available for Bolivia, Chile, Kenya and Myanmar.

#### WSF products parameters
Spatial resolution: 10m

Coord. system: WGS84 coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326)

Reference years: 2019


## Results 

Geojson file containing delineated polygons representing Urban Clusters within the selected AOI.

The polygons are projected onto the WGS84 coordinate reference system.
