# Pricing

## Calculation

The price of an order is proportionate to the user-defined area of interest (aoi) that will have to be processed. For a user-defined area of interest (aoi) and reference year (REFyear), the price is calculated as follows: 
```
101.011 km2 to 10.000.000 km2 – 0.99€ per 1.000 km2
10.000.000 km2 to 50.000.000 km2 – 0.9€ per 1.000 km2
more than 50.000.000 km2 – 0.8€ per 1.000 km2
```
The minimal price of any order is `100€`.
